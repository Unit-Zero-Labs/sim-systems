# Unit Zero Labs Tokenomics Engine

A comprehensive simulation and visualization platform for tokenomics modeling and analysis.

## Overview

The Unit Zero Labs Tokenomics Engine is an enterprise-grade simulation platform that enables blockchain projects to model, analyze, and optimize their token economics through advanced mathematical modeling and Monte Carlo simulations. Built on a parameter-first architecture, the platform automatically adapts to your project's unique tokenomics structure without requiring custom development.

## Core Capabilities

### Intelligent Parameter Discovery
- **Automatic Parameter Detection**: Seamlessly ingests tokenomics data from CSV files and automatically categorizes parameters by type and function
- **Dynamic Policy Generation**: Creates simulation policies based on detected parameters (vesting, staking, utility mechanisms, agent behavior)
- **Zero-Configuration Scaling**: Adapts from single-client deployments to enterprise-scale implementations without code modifications

### Advanced Simulation Engine
- **Monte Carlo Analysis**: Statistical modeling with confidence intervals, percentile bands, and probability distributions
- **Agent-Based Modeling**: Automatically activated when agent parameters are detected in your tokenomics structure
- **Real-Time Parameter Adjustment**: Interactive simulation controls for immediate scenario testing
- **Risk Assessment**: Quantitative analysis of downside risks and upside opportunities

### Professional Visualization Suite
- **Token Supply Dynamics**: Comprehensive analysis of circulating supply, total supply, and allocation distributions
- **Valuation Metrics**: Market capitalization, fully diluted valuation (FDV), and DEX liquidity analysis
- **Staking Economics**: APR tracking, reward distribution modeling, and delegation dynamics
- **Utility Mechanisms**: Burn rates, transfer patterns, and custom utility function analysis

## Technical Architecture

### Parameter Categories Supported
- **Tokenomics**: Supply schedules, allocation distributions, inflation/deflation mechanisms
- **Vesting**: Cliff periods, linear/non-linear release schedules, beneficiary categories
- **Staking**: Reward rates, delegation mechanics, slashing conditions
- **Pricing**: Volatility modeling, market dynamics, valuation frameworks
- **Utility Mechanisms**: Burn mechanics, transfer fees, governance tokens
- **Agent Behavior**: Trading patterns, market maker dynamics, user adoption curves

### Simulation Methodologies
- **Deterministic Modeling**: Single-run simulations for parameter testing and validation
- **Stochastic Analysis**: Multi-run Monte Carlo simulations with statistical aggregation
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: 95% confidence intervals and percentile band analysis
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Parameter impact assessment and optimization guidance
